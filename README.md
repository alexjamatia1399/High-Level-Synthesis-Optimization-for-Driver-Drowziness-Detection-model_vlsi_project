# vlsi_project
This project involves optimizing a driver drowsiness detection CNN model by first refactoring the code to make it
error-free and ready for High-Level Synthesis(HLS). HLS optimization techniques like loop tiling, loop unrolling,
array partitioning, loop merging, etc were used to improve the performance and resource utilization of the code.
In HLS4MLâ€™s report, the latency is a minimum of 88483224 clocks and the clock
period is 4.3 ns. In our optimized model, the latency is a minimum of 15390244
clocks and the clock period is 42.905 ns.
Therefore Total time taken in HLS4ML = 38,50,78,990.848 ns
Time taken in our optimized model = 66,03,18,418.82 ns
